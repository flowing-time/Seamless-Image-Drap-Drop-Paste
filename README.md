# Instructions

There are two python scripts in this resources.zip package.

final_project.py
ddp.py

final_project.py is the main python script to generate all replicated images. It can run directly in the CS6475 environment. No other packages need to be installed.

Here is the instruction to run it:

1. Creat an empty folder
2. Put the 2 scripts final_project.py and ddp.py in this folder.
3. Download the tarball images.tgz to this same folder from the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHRqsvJooJNA3JOn-R-duFH2eSRA3Zpc/view?usp=sharing
4. Execute command: tar -zxvf images.tgz
   It will create a folder "images" with 4 sub-folders: Tahoe, Yosemite, tank, and output
5. Execute command: python final_project.py
   It takes about 1 minutes on my laptop to complete. All the output images will be in the images/output folder.

Here is my laptop hardware configuration overview just for reference:
